# Introduction

Travel-O-Rama was created by Maja Jercic, to serve all the travellers to organise and save their trip infprmation in one place.

As a bit of wanderlust myself, I was always looking for an app where I could have all the details of my trips, reservation codes, places to visit, restaurants to go and try  delicious local food in and any experiences that would be a must-see. After Google Trips has been retired, I have struggled to find an app that would sasify my needs, so this was a perfct opportunity to build it myself. The goal for this page is to allow everyone to save their own trips and use them as a single reference when sightseeing, instead of swapping between multiple apps at the same time.

# UX
## Goals

### Visitor Goals
The central target audience for Trip_O-Rama are:
- Traveller, no age limit
- English-speaking (for the beginning)

User goals are:
- Have one app in which all the trip details can be saved
- Be able to access, add, edit and delete the information quickly an easily, without needing to open multiple apps and website to get the information

Why does it meet the goals?
- It's simple, intuitive
- After google Trips have been retired I haven't been able to find an app the has all of the funtionalities that I needed in one place
- The design of this site fits the conventions of similar sites, and lays out the information in a user friendly and accessible way
- The app allows adding new trips, new trip categories, editing the ones that have already been saved and deleting trips for better organisation

### Business Goals
In an advanced version, some businesses could use Travel-O-Rama:
- Airlines
- Flight search engines
- Rent-a-cars companies
- accommodation platforms, like Booking.com or Airbnb
- Local restaurants, based on the trip location
- Hotels, based on the trip location
- Local agencies, offering local experiences, based on the trip location

Business user goals are:
- A well thought-out, well designed, user-friendly platform that will benefit my business to advertise on.
- A user interface that is user-friendly for me to input my data easily and efficiently.
- Value for money (for now the app is a student project, but I would like to build on this app and start using it, so I would like to ad this goal now.)

### Travel-O-Rama Goals
- Provide an easy-to use and effective app for travellers to stay organised during the trip and find information about a specific trip
- So that I can learn and practice frontend and backend programming for the first time. To combine the use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript with Python, MongoDB, Flask and Jinja
- While a student project for now, the future goal is to implement more features and have it used by friends and family at the beginning to test it. Down the line, the plan is to include ads  by different businesses and have the app ready for a more wide-spread use.

## User stories
### Visitor Stories
As a Travel-O-Rama user, I expect/want/need to:
- To find what I am looking for easily , I want the layout of the site to make sense so I am not confused or put off using it.
- The options that I have need to be laid out in an intuitive way that is easy for me to navigate and digest, so I don't have trouble finding functionalities I need
- To be able to acces my trips easily and be able to edit or delete it without complications
- As a user accessing this site from a mobile phone or tablet, I want the site to have been designed responsively so that it is still easy to navigate and use on my smaller devices.
- As a user, I expect my trips to be saved, updated and deleted as I go through the steps to do so

### Business Stories
On the business side of things, I want/expect/need:
- To be able to access existing entries and that data to be editable on the app. (I plan on building a log-in page in the future, so user will have access to their own database of trip that are editable)
- To create, edit and delete entries
- A user interface that is simple and easy to use, laid out in a logical way with clear steps 
- To be able to crea
